```
3. Save the file
4. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`

## Step 7: Verify Deployment

2. Product will have a blockchain token ID
3. You can track all transfers and ownership changes

## Troubleshooting

### "Wrong Network" Error
- Switch to Polygon Amoy in MetaMask
- Network ID should be 80002

### "Insufficient Funds" Error
- Get free test MATIC from [Polygon Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)
- Select Amoy testnet
- Enter your wallet address

### Contract Not Working
- Ensure you copied the correct contract address
- Check if contract is deployed to Amoy (not another network)
- Verify `.env` file has correct address
- Restart dev server after changing `.env`

## Current Contract Features
âœ… Register products with unique IDs  
âœ… Transfer ownership between wallets
